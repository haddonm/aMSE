1. read in control.csv
2. read population datafile
3. generate unfished qeuilibrium zone, made up of nSAU, and numpop populations
4. test the quality of the equilibrium in mature and exploitable biomass and recruitment
5. reset the unfished exploitable biomass to average pre- and post- dynamics

Alternates:
  A. condition the unfished zone on historical data
  B. deplete the unfished SAU to predetermined levels and then add variation


HCR

gradient1 (grad1) calculation entails:

* Obtain the most recent cpue series for a SAU; select the most recent two values
* Convert the two values into proportions of the first value
* divide the second value by the first and subtract 1: (CE2/CE1) -1 to obtain the proportional change
