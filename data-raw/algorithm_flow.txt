1. read in control.csv
2. read population datafile
3. generate unfished qeuilibrium zone, made up of nSAU, and numpop populations
4. test the quality of the equilibrium in mature and exploitable biomass and recruitment
5. reset the unfished exploitable biomass to average pre- and post- dynamics

Alternates:
  A. condition the unfished zone on historical data
  B. deplete the unfished SAU to predetermined levels and then add variation
