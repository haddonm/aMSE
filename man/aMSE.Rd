\title{aMSE functions for Conditioning and Running an Invertebrate MSE}
\description{
The aMSE package provides functions to facilitate
    the conditioning and running of an invertebrate Management
    Strategy Evaluation system. The Operating model dynamics are
    based around using size-based dynamics rather than age-based
    dynamics (because most invertebrates, like abalone, are difficult
    to age accurately and consistently). The growth dynamics are
    described using the inverse logistic curve (see Haddon et al.
    2008). Earlier versions of this invertebrate MSE are described
    in Haddon et al, (2013) and Haddon and Mundy (2016). A development
    version of this R package is available on GitHub at
    https://github.com/haddonm/aMSE.
