\item{scores}{derived from the out$scores object saved from each scenario}

\item{scenes}{the scenario names}

\item{legloc}{the location of the legend, default = bottomright}

\description{
comparefinalscores takes the 'scores' object from each 'out'
    object generated by do_MSE and plots, for each sau, the median final
    HS score for each scenario within each sau, using the scenario name as
    the legend entry. 'scores' is a list object made up of two list objects
    generated in do_MSE using both 'getcpueHS' and 'plotfinalscores'. Here we
    use only the outmed list and not the outHS list. The outmed list contains
    the medians of each of the replicates scores held in outHS, and this
    function plots the median final scores for each scenario against each
    other for each sau.
