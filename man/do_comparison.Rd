\usage{
do_comparison(
  rundir,
  postfixdir,
  outdir,
  files,
  pickfiles,
  verbose = TRUE,
  intensity = 100,
  zero = FALSE,
  Q90 = TRUE,
  altscenes = NULL,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rundir}{the complete path to the directory into which all results and
plots from the comparisons will be placed.}

\item{postfixdir}{the name of the final sub-directory into which the results
will be placed. This is used as the name of the website generated to
display the results}

\item{outdir}{the full path to the directory holding all the required .RData
files. If set to '' then files is assumed to include the full path}

\item{files}{the vector of RData file names to be used. If outdir set to ''
then files is assumed to include the full path as well as the file name}

\item{pickfiles}{a vector of indices selecting the files to be used.}

\item{verbose}{should progress updates be made to the console, default=TRUE}

\item{intensity}{is the density of the rgb colours used in the ribbon plots.
the default = 100}

\item{zero}{should the phase plots have an origin at zero, default=FALSE}

\item{Q90}{default = TRUE which means the inner 90th quantiles will be
plotted. If FALSE then the 95th quantiles will be used.}

\item{altscenes}{a vector of alternative scenario names for use in plots and
tables where scenario names are very long and confuse results. default=
NULL, which implies using the base scenario names (runlabels).}

\item{juris}{which jurisdiction is being examined? default="". This is
an argument so that if there are jurisdiction specific functions for
examining outputs that may be of particular interest to a particular
jurisdiction a suitable function can be written and input, along with
any extra arguments it might have, in the final ellipsis.}

\item{ribbonleg}{location of the legend in the ribon plots, default=topleft}

\item{...}{the ellipsis is here in case a jurisdiction specific function or
functions is/are written to perform extra analyses, plots, and tables.}
}
\value{
nothing but it does conduct a comparison of at least two scenarios
    and places tables and plots into a given sub-directory
}
\description{
do_comparison provides a simplified interface for when making
    comparisons between multiple scenarios. It uses the saved .RData files
    from each scenario and it is up to the user to put those filenames into
    a vector of characters. The juris argument is an attempt at generalizing
    this comparison function and will allow for different jurisdictions to
    enable future additions to do_comparison that will suit their specific
    requirements. Currently, the only option that has been implemented is
    for juris='TAS', but others can be added now that the basic framework
    is implemented.
