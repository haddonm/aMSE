\title{logistic a Logistic selectivity function}
\usage{
logistic(inL50, delta, lens, knifeedge = 0, maxLML = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{inL50}{is the length at 50 percent selection}

\item{delta}{is the difference between the 95 percent selection and
the 50 percent selection}

\item{lens}{a vector of lengths for which the logistic maturity value
will be calculated}

\item{knifeedge}{defaults to 0. If knifeedge is set to a particular
length then the selectivity less than the value of knifeedge is set
to zero.}

\item{maxLML}{default = 0. The parameter is to allow for a slot selectivity}
}
\value{
A vector of length(lens) containing the predicted selectivity at
   length values
}
\description{
logistic a logistic selectivity function. This uses the
    logistic function 1/(1+exp(-log(19.0)*(lens-inL50)/(delta))),
    where delta = inL95 - inL50. This explicitly defines the SM50
    but uses delta (which is SM95-SM50) as the second. This ensures
    that when adding variation to parameters, to vary between
    populations, when SM95 and SM50 are close together it is not
    possible for SM50 to become larger than SM95. Be careful using the
    knifeedge option. Strictly knifeedge selectivity would entail the
    selectivity values being zero up to the knife-edge and then being 1.0.
    This is not what happens here. Instead the knifeedge option literally
    sets all values to zero at and below the value of knifeedge but leaves
    any curve above that value as it is. Hence this is not strict knife-edge
    selectivity. However, it does provide a selectivity curve that reflects
    the selectivity of a diver led fleet working on abalone.
