\usage{
getsauzone(zoneD, glb)
}
\arguments{
\item{zoneD}{the zoneD after nyrs of dynamics}

\item{glb}{the globals object}
}
\value{
a list of six matrices of nSAU columns of SAU summaries,
    and one column for the zone
}
\description{
getsauzone rowsums the matrices of matureB, exploitB,
    catch, and recruit from the input zoneD into the separate SAUs
