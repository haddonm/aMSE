This is the codebase for an Abalone Management Strategy Evaluation
framework, which we call **aMSE**. It has a novel structure that is
based around the spatial ideas of populations (or areas of persistent
production or apps, reflecting how they are defined), within spatial
management units (SAUs), within a zone:

- zone - highest geographical level. Is simply the totality of the
  spatial management units.

- SAU - spatial assessment units. In Tasmania these would currently be
  the classical statistical blocks.

- population/app - a population, herein defined as an area of persistent
  production. These are the active components within the simulation
  framework. The dynamics of the simulation are based around the
  populations, although, with positive larval dispersal (a low level is
  the default) there is some dependency of neighbouring populations on
  each other.

This conceptual structure has implications for how the simulations are
conditioned during the management strategy testing. While it is still
the case that the general properties of each SAU are used to set the
scene for each SAUâ€™s component populations, the advent of sufficient GPS
logger data now allows a more formal definition of the productivity of
each population. Currently, the modelling assumes that each population
is linearly arranged around the coastline, and this will allow, where
available, specific catch/yield data to be used to define the bounds of
each population within an SAU.

An important change from previous designs is that larval dispersal is
implemented explicitly rather than implicitly being held constant. This
alters the dynamics so that analytical equilibrium methods no longer
work and we need to resort to iterative approaches to equilibrium if the
larval dispersal rate is \> 0.0.

Of course, adding such a component increases the number of options that
may need to be explored, but currently we envisage including a very low,
a middle range, and a relatively high level of larval dispersal, to
examine its implications.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/haddonm/aMSE) with:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)){install.packages("devtools")} 

devtools::install_github("https://github.com/haddonm/aMSE")

# similarly for codeutils, hplot, EGHS, and makehtml
# knitr you should get from CRAN
```

The working of the **aMSE** software and how to use it has been
documented during the developemt and this is available as a GitBook at:

<https://haddonm.github.io/aMSEGuide/>

That can ether be read online or a PDF of the whole downloaded (look for
the small Acrobat symbool at top left).

## Example

This is an example which illustrates the generation of an initial
equilibrium, which then goes on to apply an early version of the
Tasmania MCDA using only 50 replicates (that bit takes about 15 seconds
on my computer, hence 2.5 minutes for 1000). It uses built in data-sets
but usually you would read in a control file, which would contain the
name of the biological datafile describing each population.

``` r
# a constant TAC example
starttime <- (Sys.time())
options("show.signif.stars"=FALSE,
        "stringsAsFactors"=FALSE,
        "max.print"=50000,
        "width"=240)

# You now need to ensure that there is, at least, a control??.csv, and a 
# saudata??.csv file in the data directory plus some other data .csv files
# depending on how conditioned you want the model to be. Templates for the
# correct format can be produced using ctrlfiletemplate(), datafiletemplate().
# 
# Of course, usually one would use data files, control.csv and a saudata.csv, which
# is listed as the datafile within the control.csv. These must be stored in 
# rundir. Read the Using_aMSE' section in the Documentation .docx file in the 
# documentation. To see examples of code to run the MSE for a real question.

After running the whole, even if you do not generate the results
webpage, you could also try:

``` r
#str(out$zoneDP,max.level=1)
#str1(out$hcrout)
```
