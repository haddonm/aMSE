Description: aMSE provides a formal framework for conducting management strategy 
    evaluation for abalone stocks (although, in principle, such analyses for any 
    sedentary organisms could be conducted). There are functions designed
    to facilitate the generation of input data file templates, model
    initiation and conditioning, and a standard template for the generation
    of new harvest control rules. The vignette Use_aMSE provides details
    of its operation. The smallest scenario is one SAU with one population, the
    biggest scenario could be dozens of sau and hundreds of populations, though
    large scenarios can generate very large outputs (Gb) so memory may become
    an issue. The largest implemented so far is 8 sau and 56 populations.
    The package has now been checked to operate using R4.4.1.
