Description: aMSE provides a formal framework for conducting management strategy 
    evaluation for abalone stocks (although, in principle, such analyses for any 
    sedentary organisms could be conducted). There are functions designed
    to facilitate the generation of input data file templates, model
    initiation and conditioning, and a standard template for the generation
    of new harvest control rules. The vignette Use_aMSE provides details
    of its operation. Rcpp is included in readiness of speeding various
    vital dynamics but currently no functions are implemented in Rcpp.
    The package has now been checked to operate using R4.0.0.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
