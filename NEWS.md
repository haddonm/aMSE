# aMSE 0.0.0.8940

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Currently can generate a full region, characterize its productivity, and if run with no catch or variability maintains an equilibrium, even in the presence of larval drift.

* 16-04-2020 worked on setuphtml and addfilename to simplify the use of make-html when adding a plot or table to the results for a simulation.

* 17-04-2020 0.0.0.8920: Cleaned up the make_html code to produce valid HTML5 asnd CSS3, separated the CSS code into a separate file that is linked into the different html files. Cleaned up the imports and fixed a bunch of the examples, so that there are now no errors, no warnings, and no notes. Although the examples for the read[ctrl][data][region1] functions all currently have a 'dontrun' status. An issue to fix.
